# Tanks

Tanks is a two-player tank battle game developed using C# and UnityEngine. The game allows two players to engage in combat using a single keyboard, with a dynamic camera that zooms in and out based on the distance between the tanks on the map.

## Project Overview

In Tanks, players control their tanks using a shared keyboard to battle each other. The game's camera dynamically adjusts its zoom level depending on the distance between the tanks, providing an optimal view of the battlefield.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend using a single keyboard.
- **Dynamic Camera**: The camera zooms in and out based on the distance between the tanks, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **Tank Controls**: Each player controls their tank with distinct keyboard inputs.
- **Real-time Combat**: Engage in fast-paced tank battles on a variety of maps.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Programming language used for developing game logic and mechanics.
- **UnityEngine**: Game development engine utilized for rendering graphics, physics, and gameplay mechanics.
- **.NET Framework**: Provides the runtime environment for the C# application.

## Gameplay Instructions

- **Controls**: 
  - Player 1: Use arrow keys for movement and `Space` for firing.
  - Player 2: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` for movement and `Enter` for firing.
